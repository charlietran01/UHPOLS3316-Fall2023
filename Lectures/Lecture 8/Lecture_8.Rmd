### Probabilities and Frequence Distributions Conclusion

### Other probability topics

Question 14: I flip a fair coin ten times, the probability that coin comes up heads exactly five times is:

**Let's look at a simpler example**

Exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips:

S = {TTT,TTH,THT,THH,HTT,HTH,HHT,HHH} - 8 possibilities
Possible ways it we can get exactly two tails
$s_a$s = {TTH,THT,HTT} - 3 favorable
P($s_a$) = 3/8

If we wanted **at least two tails**:
$s_b$ = {TTT,TTH,THT,HTT}
P($s_b$) = 4/8 = 1/2

**For bigger numbers this is too cumbersome to do by hand**

$$\\[4in]$$

There are 10 flips, each with two possible outcomes. which means there are $2^{10}$ possible outcomes. The number of favorable possibilities is the *combinations* that can result in 5 heads, found with the combinations formula for $\binom{n}{r}$ or $\binom{10}{5}$


+ Permutations: Order matters
+ With repetition - number possible: $n^r$
+ Without repetition - Number possible: $\frac{n!}{(n − r)!}$
+ Combinations: Order doesn't matter
+ Number possible: $\binom{n}{r}$  = \frac{n!}{r!(n − r)!}$ 


$$\\[4in]$$

**That yields this cumbersome formula:**

$\frac{10!}{(5!)^2 * 2^{10}}$

This can be rewritten as this:

$\frac{10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1}{(5*4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1)*2^{10}}$

which simplifies to 

$\frac{10*9*8*7*6}{(5*4*3*2*1)*2^{10}}$

```{r}
(10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1)/((5*4*3*2*1)^2 * 2^10)

(10*9*8*7*6)/((5*4*3*2*1)*2^10)
```
$$\\[4in]$$

 **If you see a test question on this, I would expect you to be able to:**
 
 + Identify if there is a combination vs permutation
 + Identify if it is with or without repetition
 + Complete a very simple example using sets, i.e. exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips.
 + Set up the problem without completing it. For example you might answer: 
 
        + Narrative: The answer to this problem would be figured by dividing the combination 10 choose 5 by the number of possible outcomes, which is 2 to the tenth power
        + Formula: $\frac{\binom{n}{r}}{2^{10}}$ 
        + Narrative: The favorable outcomes are a combination choosing 5 from 10 and the possible outcomes are $2^10$
        + Narrative: I would use a combination to find the favorable outcomes and use 2^10 as the total possible outcomes
 + Solving a *permutation* question may be bonus material

### Types of variables

+ Continuous - numbers with decimal places
+ Discrete - whole numbers or integers
+ Categorical - numbers just represent categories

        + Ordinal - ordered highest to lowest
        + Nominal - no particular order
        

$$\\[4in]$$


### Correlations

+ What is it?
+ 1 is perfect positive correlation

        + It doesn't mean you just multiply times 1 and get the other
        + The relationship can be complex
        + It just means there is no variation at all in the relationship
        
+ 0 is perfectly uncorrelated
+ -1 is a perfect negative correlation
+ Many ways to figure it. Probably the most common is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient:

![Pearson's Correlation Formula](pearson.jpg)
+ This is the default method when using the *cor()* function in R

### Probability Distribution Functions

+ Two meanings of function - both apply

        + Mathematical "function" - a mathematical operation or equation - *f(x)* or *g(x)*
        + R "function" - sets of instructions - mean(x) + pnorm(x)
        
+ Probability mass function (PMF) - discrete variables
+ Probability density function (PDF) - continuous variables

        + Both have the same objective
        + Probability a random variable is exactly equal to some specific value
        + PDF can not give a specific value 
        + PDF - integral over a range (calculus)
        + R does the PDF for us - *dnorm()* for normal, *dbinom()* for binomial, *dpois()* for Poisson and 17 or so others...



```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
#This code is to generate the data for the two plots
rand.norma<- rnorm(100000)

# calculate CDF 
CDF <- ecdf(rand.norma)

#This code draws the two plots, first the Red Histogram then the #Cumulative Distribution plot
#the xaxp=c(-4,4,16)  argument sets the x-axis tick marks to run from -4 to 4 and to have a total of 16 tick marks 

hist(rand.norma, breaks = 200, freq = TRUE, main = "Normal Distribution \n sd = 1, 100,000 random draws", xaxp=c(-4,4,16) , xlab = 'x', col = "red")

hist(rand.norma, breaks = 200, freq = FALSE, main = "Normal Distribution \n sd = 1, 100,000 random draws", xaxp=c(-4,4,16) , xlab = 'x', col = "red")

```
$$\\[4in]$$
+ Cumulative distribution function (CDF)

        + Gives the probability of finding the random variable at a value less than or equal to a a specific point. 
        + R does the CDF for us *pnorm()* for normal, *pbinom()* for binomial, *punif()* for uniform and 17 or so others.
        
```{r, figures-sideb, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}

#This code draws the two plots, first the Red Histogram then the #Cumulative Distribution plot
#the xaxp=c(-4,4,16)  argument sets the x-axis tick marks to run from -4 to 4 and to have a total of 16 tick marks 

hist(rand.norma, breaks = 200, freq = FALSE, main = "Normal Distribution \n sd = 1, 100,000 random draws", xaxp=c(-4,4,16) , xlab = 'x', col = "red")

plot(CDF, main = "Cumulative Distribution Function \n normal dist, sd = 1, 100,000 random draws")

```

** Related R functions

+ Similar commands for other distributions than normal
+ Quantiles (percentiles, deciles, etc.) - qnorm()

        + Works the opposite of pnorm() 
        + pnorm() tells us the probability for a value
        + qnorm() tells us the value for a probability
        
+ Random number generation - rnorm()

        + Generates *n* random numbers from a normal distribution
        + The more we create the more that it will look like that bell curve
