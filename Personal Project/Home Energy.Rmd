## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)

energy <- read.csv("IntervalData.csv") #Home Energy consumption data 11/3/22 to 11/3/23
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
organizes_dates <- energy %>% 
  select(-ESIID) %>% 
  select(-REVISION_DATE) %>% 
  filter(CONSUMPTION_SURPLUSGENERATION == "Consumption") %>% 
  select(-CONSUMPTION_SURPLUSGENERATION) %>% 
  filter(ESTIMATED_ACTUAL == "A") %>% 
  select(-ESTIMATED_ACTUAL) %>% 
  select(-USAGE_END_TIME)

df_clean <- organizes_dates %>%
  group_by(USAGE_DATE, USAGE_START_TIME) %>%
  summarise(USAGE_KWH = mean(USAGE_KWH, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

pivoted_data <- df_clean %>% pivot_wider(names_from = USAGE_DATE, values_from = USAGE_KWH)

pivoted_data$mean_of_columns <- rowMeans(pivoted_data[, -1], na.rm = TRUE)

pivoted_data$USAGE_START_TIME <- as.POSIXct(pivoted_data$USAGE_START_TIME, format="%H:%M")
pivoted_data <- pivoted_data[order(pivoted_data$USAGE_START_TIME), ]

bargph <- pivoted_data %>% 
        group_by(USAGE_START_TIME) %>% 
        ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(x = USAGE_START_TIME, 
             y = mean_of_columns),
             color = "blue",
            size = 1)
        

bargph

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
