## VDem Mini Data

This is the code used to produce the Mini Datasets for POLS 3316 projects for Fall 2013. The code also lists some important information for variables that were reviewed and those that were ultimately chosen for inclusion. Note that the Mini Datasets generally contain *no control variables.* These are for demonstration purposes only. 

The data was obtained using the R package available at  <a href = "https://github.com/vdeminstitute/vdemdata">https://github.com/vdeminstitute/vdemdata</> and described on CRAN at <"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/demcon/vignettes/clean-vdem.html">Pre-Processing the Varieties of Democracy Dataset</>

## Loading VDem data

The first two commented lines (lines that start with #) are for installing the VDem data. To use that data on your own computer, delete the leading # and run the lines. Do not delete the second hashtag in the middle of the line. The material beyond that is still a comment. 

```{r echo=TRUE}

#install.packages("devtools") #uncomment and run one time
#devtools::install_github("vdeminstitute/vdemdata") #uncomment and run one time

library(vdemdata) #load vdem library

vdem_data <- vdem #load vdem data into an object called vdem_data for local use


```
## Variables Search and descriptions

The following code and results provide information I used to together the mini datasets. 

After each topic, the name, variable type, cb_section, tag, project manager, and question are listed for many variables, several of which I used for each topic. 

The numbers at the side are indexes, so when the line breaks if you are looking at 14: Participatory Democracy Index, you would find the question asked to the experts to code this variable on the next line 14.

This is a first stop for information on any variables in the datasets that you may use.

## More information

For more information on any of these variables or to find other variables you may want to use, you can consult the <a href = "https://www.v-dem.net/documents/24/codebook_v13.pdf">VDem Codebook version 13</a>





## search topics: Civil society

This is an example of the code to find variables on a given keyword

```{r echo=TRUE}

# The next line creates an object called civ_soc_vars and uses a 
# command from the VDem package to find all VDem variabes related to
# Civil Society and assign them to the object as a data frame.
# 
civ_soc_vars <- find_var("Civil Society") 

# This returns columns 4 through 9 of the dataf rame to the screen 
# when the file is rendered.
# 
civ_soc_vars[(4:9)]


```

## search topics: conflict

```{r}

#The next two lines do the same thing for variables with
#keyword conflict

conflict_vars <- find_var("conflict")
conflict_vars[(4:9)]

```


## Search topics: income

```{r}

gdp_vars <- find_var("gdp")
gdp_vars[(4:9)]

```



## Search topics: development

```{r}

development_vars  <- find_var("development")
development_vars[(4:9)]

```
## Search topics: immigration

```{r}

immigration_vars <- find_var("immigration")
immigration_vars[(4:9)]

```




## Search topics: democracy

```{r}

democracy_vars <- find_var("democracy")
democracy_vars[(4:9)]


```

## Search topics: property rights

```{r}

property_vars <- find_var("property")
property_vars[(4:9)]


```



## Search topics: repression

```{r}

repression_vars <- find_var("repression")
repression_vars[(4:9)]


```

## Search topics: democracy

```{r}

democracy_vars <- find_var("democracy")
democracy_vars[(4:9)]


```


## Search topics: ideology

```{r}

ideology_vars <- find_var("ideology")
ideology_vars[(4:9)]


```


## Search topics: opposition

```{r}

opposition_vars <- find_var("opposition")
opposition_vars[(4:9)]

```

## Subset to 2018

- The VDem data contains information on countries going back as far as the 1800s for some things. 
- Since we do not have the tools in this class to deal with time series effects, we want a single year.
- This changes the *unit of observation* from "country-year" to the simpler "country"
- I chose 2018 to be recent but avoid pandemic related effects. This was entirely a judgment call.

```{r}

vdem_2018 <- vdem_data[which(vdem_data$year == 2018),]

```

## Civil Society and Property Rights Subset

This set contains the general Civil Society Index, Women's Civil Society Participation, general property rights, women's property rights, and men's property rights. 

```{r}

cspr_data <- vdem_2018[c("country_name","country_text_id","country_id","v2xcs_ccsi","v2x_gencs","v2xcl_prpty","v2clprptyw","v2clprptym")]

library(here)
write.csv(cspr_data,here("data_for_projects","cspr_data.csv"))

```
## Civil Society and Democracy 

This data contains the same Civil Society measures as the previous one and five measures of democracy from VDem. 

```{r}

csdem_data <- vdem_2018[c("country_name","country_text_id","country_id","v2xcs_ccsi","v2x_gencs","v2x_delibdem","v2x_egaldem","v2x_libdem","v2x_partipdem","v2x_polyarchy")]

library(here)
write.csv(csdem_data,here("data_for_projects","csdem_data.csv"))


```

This data set contains the five VDem measures of democracy plus the three measures of property rights from the previous two sets. 

## Democracy Property Rights

```{r}

demproperty_data <- vdem_2018[c("country_name","country_text_id","country_id","v2x_delibdem","v2x_egaldem","v2x_libdem","v2x_partipdem","v2x_polyarchy","v2xcl_prpty","v2clprptyw","v2clprptym")]

library(here)
write.csv(demproperty_data,here("data_for_projects","demproperty_data.csv"))

```
