# Probabilities and Frequence Distributions Conclusion

## Other probability topics

Pre-quiz Question 14: I flip a fair coin ten times, the probability that coin comes up heads exactly five times is:


## Simpler example

- Exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips:

- Question: In general, using sets how would we start? 


## Simpler example

- Exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips:

- Question: In general, using sets how would we start? 

- Answer: define the sample space

- Question: What is the sample space for this problem?

## Simple example: Sample space

- The sample space is:

S = {TTT , TTH , THT , THH , HTT , HTH , HHT , HHH} 

What is our total *possible outcomes* or the number of elements in the samples space? 

## Simple example: Sample space

- The sample space is:

S = {TTT , TTH , THT , THH , HTT , HTH , HHT , HHH} 

What is our total *possible outcomes* or the number of elements in the samples space? 8 <p style="font-size: x-large">(Note that with 3 trials of two possible outcomes this is $2^3$)</p>

- What is our next general step?


## Simple example: Sample space

- The sample space is:

S = {TTT , TTH , THT , THH , HTT , HTH , HHT , HHH} 

What is our total *possible outcomes* or the number of elements in the samples space? 8 <p style="font-size: x-large">(Note that with 3 trials of two possible outcomes this is $2^3$)</p>

- Question: What is our next general step?

- Answer: Define the event space


## Simple example: Event space

- The event space is possible ways that we can get *exactly* two tails
- In probability, this is our *favorable outcomes*
- What is our event space?

## Simple example: Event space

- What is our event space?  
- s = {TTH,THT,HTT} 
- Question: What is our *favorable outcomes* or number of elements in the event space?

## Simple example: Event space

- What is our event space?  
- s = {TTH,THT,HTT} 
- Question: What is our *favorable outcomes* or number of elements in the event space? 
- Answer: 3
- Question: So what is the probability?

## Simple example: Probability

- P(A) = $\frac{favorable_A}{all \; possible \; outcomes_A}$

- P(s) = $\frac{favorable_S}{all \; possible \; outcomes_S}$
- favorable_S is the event space *s*
- P(s) = 


## Simple example: Probability

- P(A) = $\frac{favorable_A}{all \; possible \; outcomes_A}$

- P(s) = $\frac{favorable_S}{all \; possible \; outcomes_S}$
- favorable_S is the event space *s*
- P(s) = $\frac{3}{8}$

## Slightly more complicated example

- If we wanted **at least two tails**
- The sample space is unchanged with 8 elements
- Q: What is the event space, $s_b$

## Slightly more complicated example

- If we wanted **at least two tails**
- The sample space is unchanged with 8 elements
- Q; What is the event space, $s_b$
- A: $s_b$ = {TTT,TTH,THT,HTT}
- Q: What is the total elements? 
- Q: What is the probability?

## Slightly more complicated example

- If we wanted **at least two tails**
- The sample space is unchanged with 8 elements
- Q; What is the event space, $s_b$
- A: $s_b$ = {TTT,TTH,THT,HTT}
- Q: What is the total elements? 4
- Q: What is the probability? $\frac{4}{8}$

## Bigger numbers
 
- **For bigger numbers this is too cumbersome to do by hand**
- But conceptually this is how we derive probabilities
- Thinking in terms of sample and event spaces can be useful in understanding how to solve problems and in understanding probabilities we are given. 
- We have rules for *combinations* and *permutations*
- If you master these rules you will get a better GRE score than me

## Combinations and permutations

- Permutations: Order matters
- With repetition - number possible: $n^r$
- Without repetition - Number possible: $\frac{n!}{(n − r)!}$

- Combinations: Order doesn't matter
- Number possible: $\binom{n}{r}$  = $\frac{n!}{r!(n − r)!}$ 

## Question 14: Combinations

Question 14: I flip a fair coin ten times, the probability that coin comes up heads exactly five times is:

There are 10 flips, each with two possible outcomes. which means there are $2^{10}$ possible outcomes. The number of favorable possibilities is the *combinations* that can result in 5 heads, found with the combinations formula 

- $\binom{n}{r}$ or $\binom{10}{5}$
- or $\frac{n!}{r!(n − r)!}$ 

## Question 14

- **That yields this cumbersome formula:**

$\frac{10!}{(5!)^2 * 2^{10}}$

- This can be rewritten as this:

$\frac{10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1}{(5*4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1)*2^{10}}$

- which simplifies to 

$\frac{10*9*8*7*6}{(5*4*3*2*1)*2^{10}}$

## Potential Test Questions

 **If you see a test question on this, I would expect you to be able to:**
 
- Identify if there is a combination vs permutation
- Identify if it is with or without repetition
- Solving a *permutation* question may be bonus material
- Complete a very simple example using sets, i.e. exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips.

        - For this I might ask for a numeric answer, to pick the correct sample space from a list, to pick the correct event space from a list, or some other stage of the problem.
        
 - Set up the problem without completing it. For example see next slide:
 
## Set up without completing examples
 
- Narrative: The answer to this problem would be figured by dividing the combination 10 choose 5 by the number of possible outcomes, which is 2 to the tenth power
- Formula: $\frac{\binom{n}{r}}{2^{10}}$ 
- Narrative: The favorable outcomes are a combination choosing 5 from 10 and the possible outcomes are $2^10$
- Narrative: I would use a combination to find the favorable outcomes and use 2^10 as the total possible outcomes

## If you intend to take the GRE

- These are a substantial number of GRE quantitative section questions and they can be both tricky and time consuming if you don't know them well.

## Types of variables

- We need to know types of variables because they affect how we should treat the data. 
- The techniques for this class are only completely valid for one type: continuous.


## Types of variables

- Continuous - numbers with decimal places
- Discrete - whole numbers or integers
- Categorical - numbers just represent categories

        - Ordinal - ordered highest to lowest
        - Nominal - no particular order
        
- Binary - choice of two alternatives such as war/peace
- Count variables

## Continuous variable: examples

- temperature
- amount of rain in a city
- height in inches $^t$
- age $^t$
- **nations' GDP**
- **household income**
- population 

<p style="font-size: medium">$^t$ Technically only if we measure to fairly small fractions, but see the slide following the next.</p>

## Discrete variable: examples

- number of days with a high above 90 degrees
- number of days of rain in a city
- height in feet
- age in decades
- **GDP by billions**
- **income by ranges of $5,000**
- **district magnitude**

## Discrete v. Continuous

- The distinction between discrete and continuous is a matter of judgment. At the smallest level, called the Planck scale in physics, every physical measurement is discrete.
- It is the size of the measurement vs the size of the gaps that matter

        - measuring by centimer if we are measuring 5 centimeters is discrete
        - measuring by centimer if we are measuring 1000 km is continuous
        
<p style="font-size: large">Planck scale: $10x10^{−35}$ m, $5x10^-{44}$ seconds</p>

## Categorical: Nominal

1. Numbers that represent categories in no particular order.
2. We can't do math on the numbers because the numbers really just represent names. 

- color
- **ethnicity**
- **religion**
- **country of origin**
- **zip code**
- **form of government**

## Categorical: Ordinal

1. Order matters.
2. We still can't use math because the numbers don't represent ratios, just order

## Categorical: Ordinal

- hot, warm, cool, cold
- Movie ratins (G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17)
- **Education level**
- **Likert scales**
- **Regime type**

        - Closed Authocracy
        - Electoral Autocracy
        - Electoral Democracy
        - Liberal Democracy
        
## What do we do with categorical variables?

- As independent variables, R can handle them by treating them as *factors*
- As dependent variables, we have to use more advanced Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) techniques

## Binary variables

- **yes/no** as in a survey answer
- **war/peace**
- **democracy/non-democracy**
- **proportional/majoritarian**
- **freedom/slavery**


## Count variables (Poisson variables)

- Number of days of rain in a city in a year
- Number of text messages per hour
- Number of militarized interstate disputes per country per year
- Number of men kicked to death by horses per Prussian cavalry unit per year (Ladislaus Bortkiewicz, 1898)

## Types of variables

We need to know types of variables because they affect how we should treat the data. :

- Different types have different distributions
- Simple statistics treating categorical variables as continuous or discrete numerical values yield false results
- Discrete values may be misinterpreted



## Correlation and Covariance

- Related measures
- Do not worry about computing them for the test
- You should understand what they measure


## Correlation

+ What is correlation?

- The strength of association between two variables


## Correlation of 1

- 1 is perfect positive correlation

        - It doesn't mean you just multiply times 1 and get the other
        - The relationship can be complex (not a line)
        - It just means there is no variation at all in the relationship
        
##  Correlation of 0    
        
- 0 is perfectly uncorrelated
- There is zero relationship between the variables

## Negative correlation

- -1 is a perfect negative correlation
- It is still a perfect correlation
- Indicates that when one increases the other decreases in perfect relationship
- Like a correlation of 1, it can be complex

## Computing correlations

- Many ways to figure correlation
- Probably the most common is Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
- Pearson's correlation is the default method when using the *cor()* function in R

## Computing correlations

- The formula for Pearson's correlation is:

![Pearson's Correlation Formula](pearson.jpg)



## Covariance 

- What is covariance?
- A measure of the joint variability of two random variables
- Measures the direction of the relationship
- Correlation measures strength of the relationship

## Covariance  Formula

- The formual for covariance is:

![Covariance formula](covariance_formula.jpg)


## Finding correlation from covariance

- Cor(x,y) = $\frac{Cov(x,y)}{\sigma_x,\sigma_y}$

- $\sigma_x$ is standard deviation of x
- $\sigma_y$ is standard deviation of y
