## Agenda

- Last things before hypothesis testing

        - Finish probability - m
        - Finish frequency distribution - m
        - Types of variables - a
        - Correlations, covariance - t

- practice stats problems by hand

<p style="font-size: x-large">m = basis of methods of testing; a = assumptions about methods; t = what we are testing</p>


## Announcements and reminders

- Exam in this classroom October 11

        - Calculator (no phones)
        - Pencils/pens
        - 1 page single sided of notes
        - blank scratch paper
        - Formula sheet will be printed on the test
        
# Probabilities and Frequence Distributions Conclusion

## Other probability topics

Pre-quiz Question 14: I flip a fair coin ten times, the probability that coin comes up heads exactly five times is:


## Simpler example

- Exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips:

- Question: In general, using sets how would we start? 


## Simpler example

- Exactly 2 tails out of 3 flips:

- Question: In general, using sets how would we start? 

- Answer: define the sample space

- Question: What is the sample space for this problem?

## Simple example: Sample space

- The sample space is:

S = {TTT , TTH , THT , THH , HTT , HTH , HHT , HHH} 

What is our total *possible outcomes* or the number of elements in the samples space? 

## Simple example: Sample space

- The sample space is:

S = {TTT , TTH , THT , THH , HTT , HTH , HHT , HHH} 

What is our total *possible outcomes* or the number of elements in the samples space? 8 <p style="font-size: x-large">(Note that with 3 trials of two possible outcomes this is $2^3$)</p>

- What is our next general step?

- Question: What is our next general step?

- Answer: Define the event space


## Simple example: Event space

- The event space is possible ways that we can get *exactly* two tails
- In probability, this is our *favorable outcomes*
- What is our event space?

## Simple example: Event space

- What is our event space?  
- s = {TTH,THT,HTT} 
- Question: What is our *favorable outcomes* or number of elements in the event space?

## Simple example: Event space

- What is our event space?  
- s = {TTH,THT,HTT} 
- Question: What is our *favorable outcomes* or number of elements in the event space? 
- Answer: 3
- Question: So what is the probability?

## Simple example: Probability

- P(A) = $\frac{favorable_A}{all \; possible \; outcomes_A}$

- P(s) = $\frac{favorable_S}{all \; possible \; outcomes_S}$
- favorable_S is the event space *s*
- P(s) = 


## Simple example: Probability

- P(A) = $\frac{favorable_A}{all \; possible \; outcomes_A}$

- P(s) = $\frac{favorable_S}{all \; possible \; outcomes_S}$
- favorable_S is the event space *s*
- P(s) = $\frac{3}{8}$

## Slightly more complicated example

- If we wanted **at least two tails**
- The sample space is unchanged with 8 elements
- Q: What is the event space, $s_b$

## Slightly more complicated example

- If we wanted **at least two tails**
- The sample space is unchanged with 8 elements
- Q; What is the event space, $s_b$
- A: $s_b$ = {TTT,TTH,THT,HTT}
- Q: What is the total elements? 
- Q: What is the probability?

## Slightly more complicated example

- If we wanted **at least two tails**
- The sample space is unchanged with 8 elements
- Q; What is the event space, $s_b$
- A: $s_b$ = {TTT,TTH,THT,HTT}
- Q: What is the total elements? 4
- Q: What is the probability? $\frac{4}{8}$

## Bigger numbers
 
- **For bigger numbers this is too cumbersome to do by hand**
- But conceptually this is how we derive probabilities
- Thinking in terms of sample and event spaces can be useful in understanding how to solve problems and in understanding probabilities we are given. 
- We have rules for *combinations* and *permutations*
- If you master these rules you will get a better GRE score than me

## Combinations and permutations

- Permutations: Order matters
- With repetition - number possible: $n^r$
- Without repetition - Number possible: $\frac{n!}{(n − r)!}$

- Combinations: Order doesn't matter
- Number possible: $\binom{n}{r}$  = $\frac{n!}{r!(n − r)!}$ 

## Question 14: Combinations

Question 14: I flip a fair coin ten times, the probability that coin comes up heads exactly five times is:

There are 10 flips, each with two possible outcomes. which means there are $2^{10}$ possible outcomes. The number of favorable possibilities is the *combinations* that can result in 5 heads, found with the combinations formula 

- $\binom{n}{r}$ or $\binom{10}{5}$
- or $\frac{n!}{r!(n − r)!}$ 

## Question 14

- **That yields this cumbersome formula:**

$\frac{10!}{(5!)^2 * 2^{10}}$

- This can be rewritten as this:

$\frac{10*9*8*7*6*5*4*3*2*1}{(5*4*3*2*1)*(5*4*3*2*1)*2^{10}}$

- which simplifies to 

$\frac{10*9*8*7*6}{(5*4*3*2*1)*2^{10}}$
