## Hypothesis tests

**$X^2$ and t-test are simple enough to work out with a calculator, so a small data version of each will be on the final**

- For $X^2$, I may give an intermediate step such as the column and row totals (marginal frequencies) and expected values and let you solve from there.
- I might also give you the t-score and ask you to find the p-value from a table.
- There will be at least one question where you work through one of these tests from start to finish.

## Chi-Square review

- $X^2$ (Chi-squared) test
- For categorical variables
- aka as cross-tabs because of the format
- worked through a $X^2$ test problem together 
- This is on Problem Sets 5/6 and final 
                
                
## Today

- Concepts of Z-score (review), Student's t-test, and ANOVA
- Where each one is appropriate
- Brief discussion of the formulas for all three
- We will work through a paired sample t-test together as our second example of hypothesis testing
- Paired t-test is on Problem Set 5/6 and final 
                

## Hypothesis test uses
 
- $X^2$ (Chi squared): Categorical variables with counts
- Student's t-test: compares the means of two groups
- z-score: continuous, normally distributed variables
- ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- Lots of others!

## Hypothesis test uses
 
- $X^2$ (Chi squared): Categorical variables with counts

- $X^2$ test of goodness of fit - tells whether the sample data is representative of the population

- $X^2$ test of indendependence (we dit this) - tells us if two categorical variables are related or not

## Student's t-test: compares the means of two groups 

- Developed by William Sealy Gosset, who published under the pseudonym Student
- Gosset worked for Guinness and was interested in the quality of barley malt for use in brewing beer
- He was interested in small sample sizes, so he developed the t-test
- He also developed the concept of statistical power
- He was a chemist, not a statistician, so he published under a pseudonym



## Student's t-test: compares the means of two groups 
               
- pairwise comparison: what are the pairs?

        - one sample: comparing one group against a standard value
        - two-sample or independent t-test: compares two groups from different populations 
        - paired t-test: compares a single group as in before and after comparison

- One or two tails

        - Two tailed test: tells if they are different, either greater or less
        - One tailed test: tells if one group is specifically greater or less, bot not either
        
Other points:

        - degrees of freedom = n - 1
        - When t-test degrees of freedom > 30, it converges on the z-score
        - t-test is more conservative than z-score
        
## More conservative than the z-score: distribution of t-scores

## More conservative than the z-score: distribution of t-scores 

![t vs z dist](tzdist.png)
                

                
## z-score: continuous, normally distributed variables
                        
- Continuous variables 
- normal distribution

        - Central Limit Theorem can get us to normal distribution
        
- known population standard deviation 

        - "known" ~ accepted estimate of the population standard deviation from LLN and CLT

- Use if: if the population standard deviation is known or reliably estimated and sample size > 30
                

                
## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

- tests difference of means between 3 or more indendepnt groups
- This is often used to test removing variables one at a time from a multi-variable model (something we will not be doing)
- Uses the *F-test*
- The same F-test in regression results - model fit
                
              

## Deeper look at t-tests
 
- Paired sample t-test
- $t = \frac{\bar{x}_{diff}}{\sigma_{diff}/\sqrt{n}}$
 
<br><br> 

- $\bar{x}_{diff}$: sample mean of the differences
- $\sigma_{diff}$: sample standard deviation of the differences
- n: sample size (in pairs)

## Second Example Data:


Group 1: (12.2, 14.6, 13.4, 11.2, 12.7, 10.4, 15.8, 13.9, 9.5, 14.2)
Group 2: (13.5, 15.2, 13.6, 12.8, 13.7, 11.3, 16.5, 13.4, 8.7, 14.6)
