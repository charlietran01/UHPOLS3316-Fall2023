## Hypothesis Testing: Chi-square $X^2$

- Background
- Examples
- Practice


## What is $X^2$ 

- Frequency distribution
- Used in hypothesis testing
- Categorical variables
- Ideal sample size 50- 1000

                + Less than 10 very unreliable
                
- Two hypothesis tests

                - Test of goodness of fit (1 variable)
                - **Test of independence (2 variables)*
                
## $X^2$ Test of independence

- Categorical variables 

        + Testing if categories are related
        + Men/women, Republicans/Democracts, Northerners/Southerners, Black/White
        
- 2nd variable is the thing we look for a difference in

        + Pay, attitudes toward taxes, attitudes toward military service, victimization by police
        

## $X^2$ Test

-  $X^2$ tests the P($\frac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected}$)
- The score is $\frac{(Observed - Expected)^2}{Expected}$) 
- Expected = $\frac{row total x column total}{sample size}$
- H0 (null hypothesis): in the population, the two categorical variables are independent *not related*
- H1 (alternative/research hypothesis): in the population, the two categorical variables are dependent *related*
- p-value is P(random effect > computed effect) *so smaller is better*

## Chi Square Visualization

## Not a normal distribution

- the sum of the squares of k independent, zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian random variables
