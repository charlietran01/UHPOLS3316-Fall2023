## Regression (Part 2)

-   Review

-   More on some terms that have been used occasionally: fit, fitted, predicted, residual, predictors, estimates (plus estimator and estimand)

-   Regression with two or more Xs: multiple linear regression

- Interpreting Regression Results

## Review

<p style="color:red;text-align:center;font-size: 40px;">

$y = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon$

</p>

##   Assumptions (Testable)

- Linearity
- Normality
- Independence
- Homoskedasticity
- No *perfect* multicollinearity


## The process of *least squared* residuals

- Similar to the process of finding variance by measuring squared distances to the mean
- This measures squared distances to the line given by the equation
- The method aims to minimize the sum of the squared distances - the sum of squared residuals

## New terms (or new definitions)

-   fit, fitted, predicted - the model's prediction for the expected value of y for a given value of x
-   predictors - x variables
-   estimates (plus estimator and estimand) - the values of the parameters (alpha and beta) estimated by the model
-   residual - the vertical distance between the observed and the estimated (fitted, predicted) using estimated parameters.


## Multiple Linear Regression

-   During the lecture on causation, I said that causes aren't simple - there are often multiple causes

-   So how do we analyze 2 (or 3 or 20) explanatory (X) variables?

## Multiple Linear Regression: Answer

With OLS regression.

When we add a second X, we add a new axis so now we don't have a line, we have the 3d equivalent::

## Multiple Linear Regression: Answer

We can't really visualize more than two Xes geometrically, but the idea is the same.


## Interpreting and writing regression results
