## Plan for Today

+ Next lecture:

                - Frequency distributions
                - Probability using R frequency distribution functions
                
+ Expectations for today: 

                -Understand how probability applies to the study of political (or any) science. 
                - Understand basic assumptions/rules about probability. 
                - Be able to do relatively simple probability computations by hand. Code will be provided to them in R

##  What is probability?

**Mathematical probability: the ratio of the cases of interest to the whole number of cases possible.**

P(A) = $\frac{possible_A}{all \; possible \; outcomes}$

This is often phrased as ratio of "favorable outcomes" to possible outcomes, where favorable means outcomes where A occurs. 

<p style="font-size: large">Unfortunate phrasing. Does not mean a "good" outcome.For example, in the study of war it might mean the outcomes where war occurs. </p>

## Example: Coin flip

If we call heads "favorable"

- The ratio of 
- heads on a fair coin: 1


## Example: Coin flip

If we call heads "favorable"

- The ratio of 
- heads on a fair coin: 1
- to the whole number of cases possible:


## Example: Coin flip

If we call heads "favorable"

- The ratio of 
- heads on a fair coin: 1 
- to the whole number of cases possible:
- heads on a fair coin + tails on a fair coin = 2


## Example: Coin flip

If we call heads "favorable"

- The ratio of 
- heads on a fair coin: 1 
- to the whole number of cases possible:
- heads on a fair coin + tails on a fair coin = 2

 - $\frac{1}{2}$
 
 
## Other examples

Other examples work the same way just with more possible cases and different ratios

- Normal fair dice:

## Probability in statistical inference

We do something similar when trying to *infer* something about the way the world works from statistical data


## Probability in statistical inference


**Probability in statistical inference: Proportional times an outcome occurs if the experiment (or observation/data collection) is repeated a large number of times. ** (This should go on your exam notes!)

This is the **frequentist** interpretation. There is an important alternative definition you should be aware of, but that you are not responsible for in this class, the **Bayesian** interpretation


## Bayesian interpretation

**Bayesian probability suggests that in statistical inference, probability is a method of updating our beliefs based on new evidence. This is based on Bayes Rule, which has been called "the most important rule in data science."**

## Bayes Rule

![bayes rule](bayes.png)

- P(A|B) - This is read: The probability of A given B. 

- P(A) is our *prior* (existing) probability of A given no information about B. 

- In other words, if we know that B is true (given B) what is the probability that A happens.

[https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/](https://betterexplained.com/articles/an-intuitive-and-short-explanation-of-bayes-theorem/)

Good explanation using set notation:
[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prior_probability.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/prior_probability.asp)

- You are responsible for understanding that Bayes rule gives us a way of determining the *conditional probability* of something given a set of *prior* probabilities. 
- You also need to understand that the results are often counterintuitive at first glance. (Also, often at 2nd, 3rd, 4th...)


## Some more set and probability terms

+ Sample space:  S - the set of possible outcomes
+ Event: s - a subset of the sample space of any size
+ s $\in$ S - s is an element of S
+ Empty set: $\emptyset$ - A subset of the sample space with no elements
+ The complement of s: $s^c$ - is all the elements of the sample space that is not s. 

## Set notation: Examples 1

+ S = {5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ s = {7,8}
+ $s^c$ = {5,6,9,10}

## Set notation: Examples 2

+ S = {5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ s = $\emptyset$ 
+ $s^c$ = {5,6,7,8,9,10}

## Set notation: Practice

+ S = {5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ s = {6,7,8,9,10}
+ $s^c$ = 



## More notation and terms

+ Union $\cup$ - A $\cup$ B is all outcomes that belong to either A or B or both. 
+ Intersection $\cap$ - A $\cap$ B is all outcomes that belong to both A and B. 
+ If A $\cap$ B  = $\emptyset$ the two sets are *disjoint*.

## Set notation: Examples 3:

+ A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
+ B = {5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ A $\cup$ B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ A $\cap$ B = [5,6]

## Set notation: Examples 4

+ A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
+ B = {10}
+ A $\cup$ B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ A $\cap$ B = ______

## Set notation: Examples 5

+ A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
+ B = {7,8,9}
+ C = {10}
+ D = B $\cup$ C 
+ A $\cup$ D = 



## Probability assumptions and rules

+ Probability is always between zero and one

## Probability assumptions and rules

+ Probability is always between zero and one
+ Each possible outcome has a probability between zero and one


## Probability assumptions and rules

+ Each possible outcome has a probability between zero and one
+ The probability that something occurs is 1


## Probability assumptions and rules

+ Each possible outcome has a probability between zero and one
+ The probability that something occurs is 1


## Probability assumptions and rules

+ Probability is always between zero and one
+ Each possible outcome has a probability between zero and one
+ The probability that something occurs is 1
+ The probability that nothing occurs is 0
+ The probability of something is 1 minus the probability of its opposite


## Probability assumptions and rules

+ Probability is always between zero and one
+ Each possible outcome has a probability between zero and one
+ The probability that something occurs is 1
+ The probability that nothing occurs is 0
+ The probability of something is 1 minus the probability of its opposite
+ For two mutually exclusive sets, the probability of the union of the sets is the sum of their probabilities



## Probabilities of opposites

+ S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ A = {1,2,3,4,5}
+ B = {6,7,8,9,10}

A & B are opposites and complements. 

+ P(A) = 5 / 10 
+ P(B) = 1 - (5 / 10) = 5 / 10

## Probabilities Examples: 1

+ S = {Heads, Tails}
+ P(Heads) = 1 / 2
+ P(Tails) = 1 - P(Heads) = 1 / 2

## Example of mutually exclusive sets: 

+ S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ A = {1,2,3,4,5}
+ B = {6,7,8,9,10}

+ P (A) = 5 / 10
+ P(B) = 5 / 10
+ P(A $\cup$ B) = 

## What if:

+ S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
+ A = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
+ B = {5,6,7,8,9,10}

+ P (A) = 6 / 10
+ P(B) = 6 / 10
+ P(A $\cup$ B) = 

+ B $\cap$ A = {5,6}
+ P(B $\cap$ A) = 2 / 10
