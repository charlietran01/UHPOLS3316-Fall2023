## Confidence Intervals

+ Review $X^2$ and t-test 
+ General hypothesis testing: scores and critical values
+ Confidence intervals 

## $X^2$ and t-test

+ Note on formulas: Numbers in numerator or denominator of a fraction all get solved together as if in parentheses. PEMDAS is shorthand, but the P should really be G for "grouping symbols" and includes:  parentheses ( ), brackets [ ], braces \{ \}, and even fraction bars.

## Terms

- null hypothesis
- alternative hypothesis
- critical value (cutoff point)
- critical value is found using degrees of freedom and desired probability or alpha. (In z-scores, only probability is needed.)
- probability or p - confidence level 



## Test Scores and Critical Values

- if the test score is greater than the critical value, reject the null

- The critical value is minimum
- Above that value, the probability that the null hypothesis is true is equal to or less than the target so we reject
- This all leads to confidence intervals
                

 
 # Confidence intervals
 
 ## What is a confidence interval?
 
- Range where we could expect to find the true measurement based on the probability level we specify if we had the full population data instead of just the sample. 
- Range where we expect to find the true population parameter given the sample statistic
- If we say the 95% confidence interval of the mean is from 45 to 55, it means we are 95% certain that the true population mean lies somewhere in that range. 
        
## Getting the confidence interval
        
- The confidence intervals are based on the thing we actually measured, the probability level, and the distribution. 
- If we know the population parameters (especially standard deviation) we can create simple CI using 68-95-99 rule or accurate CI using z-scores
- For small samples or uncertain population standard deviation we use appropriate distributions, such as Student's t, to adjust for both these uncertainties 

              
  
 
## Using t-scores to find confidence intervals

 
- For small samples or uncertain population standard deviation we use t-scores to adjust for these uncertainties 
 
                - If we wanted to get a 95% confidence interval with 68-95-99, we would look for a value 2 standard deviations either side of the statistic we want to find a CI for 
                - With t-test scores we divide the standard deviation by the square root of sample size and multiply times a t-table critical value instead.
                - We can get the critical value using the qt() function in R as in the examples

## Using t-scores to find confidence intervals
 
          
- $CI_\mu$ Confidence interval of the population mean
                
- $CI_\mu$ = $\bar{x} \pm t \frac{\sigma_{s}}{\sqrt{n}}$



Where:

- $\bar{x}$ = Sample mean
- $\mu$ = Population mean
- $\sigma_{s}$ = sample standard deviation
- n = sample size

     
 
## What about the normal distribution?

The 68-95-99 rule gives an oversimplified CI. 

For normal distributions, the actual formula is:

## What about the normal distribution?

$CI_\mu$ Confidence interval of the population mean

$CI_\mu = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$

Where:

$\bar{x}$ Sample mean
$\sigma$ population standard deviation
$n$ is the sample size

+ We can get the z-score from a z-table or from the qnorm() function in R


## Examples:

We'll go through a couple of example computations, then I'll provide you some sample R lab scripts (Quarto files).

## Examples:

- Sample mean: 50 = $\bar{x}$
- Sample standard deviation 5 = $\sigma_{s}$
- Sample size 18 = $n$
- Looking for a 95% confidence interval. 

We need the t-score for a two-tailed test:

```{r echo=TRUE}

qt(.025,17)

```


## Examples:

```{r echo=TRUE}

qt(.025,17)

```

Then we can fill in the formula:

+ $CI_\mu$ = $\bar{x} \pm t \frac{\sigma_{s}}{\sqrt{n}}$

```{r echo=TRUE}

50 + c(-2.11, 2.11) * 5 / sqrt(18)

```


## Example 2:

Using the z-score:

- Sample mean: 50
- Population standard deviation: 5
- Sample size: 500

- We need a z-score for 95% (.025% above and .025% below):

```{r echo=TRUE}

qnorm(.025)

```
## Example 2

Then we apply the formula:

$CI_\mu = \bar{x} \pm z \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$


```{r echo=TRUE}

50 + c(-1.96, 1.96) * 5 / sqrt(500)



```


                
                
## Is this just about means?

NO!

The biggest use I see of confidence intervals is confidence intervals for **regression coefficients**

- $y = \alpha + \beta X + \epsilon$
                
If we find that the $\beta$ in the equation defining the relationship between our explanatory (x) and dependent (y) variables is 0.9, the confidence interval can tell us that it's actually 95% likely that the true relationship is between 0.88 and 0.92. 

Even better, we can graph it...

## Sample of graphing confidence interval in OLS



```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)

# plot the data  

ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE) +
  theme_economist() +
  labs(title = "Confidence Interval for Regression Coefficient",
       subtitle = "95% Confidence Interval for the Slope",
       caption = "Source: mtcars dataset from R") + 
        xlab("Weight") + 
        ylab("Miles per Gallon") 



```
